# CLI Guide Project

## Overview

The CLI Guide Project is a collaborative effort to create a comprehensive guide for command-line interface (CLI) commands and their usage. Our goal is to provide users with a centralized resource where they can learn about various CLI commands and interact with them in a simulated terminal environment.
